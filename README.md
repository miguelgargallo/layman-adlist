##  Features

- **unique domains:** Every domain in the hosts file is unique.
- **hosts based:** all the bad stuffs blocked with `0.0.0.0`
- **any device:** compatible with all devices, regardless of OS, blocking on network wide.
- **blockings:** strictly blocks `advertisements, malwares, spams, statistics & trackers` on both web browsing and applications.
- **speed you need:** reduces page loading time!
- **privacy:** with all these annoyances blocking, it also `increases` privacy.
- **saves expense:** greatly decreases data consumption `saving` expense.
- **clean:** no `extra` bullshit!

## What is a hosts file?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file used
by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`. Therefore
if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never leaves your
computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware,
and other irritants.

For example, to nullify requests to some doubleclick.net servers, adding these
lines to your hosts file will do it:

```text
# block doubleClick's servers
0.0.0.0 ad.ae.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.ar.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.at.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.au.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.be.doubleclick.net
# etc...
```

## We recommend using `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

Traditionally most host files use `127.0.0.1`, the _loopback address_, to
establish an IP connection to the local machine.

We prefer to use `0.0.0.0`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address used
to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target.

Using `0.0.0.0` is empirically faster, possibly because there's no wait for a
timeout resolution. It also does not interfere with a web server that may be
running on the local PC.
